# Google Hash Code (Base)
Problem independant scaffold to be used in the Google Hash Code competition. Idealy, one should be able to code without creating any file or having to search for a library.

The code is already organised and some useful functions/extensions/libraries are provided. It includes :
- a sscanf 
- a mutable/immutable min/max PriorityQueue
- a mutableSet

Compilation (on linux) puts a compressed copy of the current sources in the `outputs` folder.
